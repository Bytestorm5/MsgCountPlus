A discord bot that tracks activity within discord servers and graphs them in nice ways. This was one of my first major coding projects- while I had messed with programming since 4th grade (via Scratch, Visual Basic, etc.), this was one of my first real projects.

It's not very good (in fact it's pretty bad), but I'm proud of it for the lessons I learned doing it- which goes for a lot of my projects, but especially this one.

This bot did work, in some capacity, back in the day. I think I had something like 500-700 servers that were using this bot. Makes me wonder what could have been if I knew how to do this properly. 

It might not look like it, but I completely rewrote this thing from scratch 3 or 4 times- each time failing because I would scope-creep myself and kill the project in doing so.
